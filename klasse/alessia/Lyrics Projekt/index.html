    <p>...</p>
    <p>In the USA, the big CIA</p>
    <p>The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK</p>
    
    <p>But if you only have love for your own race</p>
    <p>Then you only leave space to discriminate</p>
    <p>And to discriminate only generates hate</p>
    <p>And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah</p>
    
    <p>Madness is what you demonstrate</p>
    <p>And that's exactly how anger works and operates</p>
    <p>Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight</p>
    <p>Take control of your mind and meditate</p>
    <p>Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all</p>
        
    <p>People killin', people dyin'</p>
    <p>Children hurt, hear them cryin'</p>
    <p>Can you practice what you preach</p>
    <p>Or would you turn the other cheek?</p>
    
    <p>Father, Father, Father, help us</p>
    <p>Send some guidance from above</p>
    <p>'Cause people got me, got me questionin'</p>
    <p>Where is the love (love)</p>
    
    <p>Where is the love? (The love)</p>
    <p>Where is the love? (The love)</p>
    <p>Where is the love, the love, the love?</p>
    
    <p>It just ain't the same, old ways have changed</p>
    <p>New days are strange, is the world insane?</p>
    <p>If love and peace are so strong</p>
    <p>Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?</p>
    
    <p>Nations droppin' bombs</p>
    <p>Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones</p>
    <p>With ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young</p>
    <p>So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?</p>
    
    <p>So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong</p>
    <p>In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in</p>
    <p>Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends</p>
    <p>Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother</p>
    <p>A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover</p>
    
    <p>The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug</p>
    <p>If you never know truth then you never know love</p>
    <p>Where's the love, y'all, come on? (I don't know)</p>
    <p>Where's the truth, y'all, come on? (I don't know)</p>
    <p>Where's the love, y'all?</p>

    <p>Where is the love? (The love)</p>
    <p>Where is the love, the love, the love?</p>
    
    <p>I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder</p>
    <p>As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder</p>
    <p>Most of us only care about money makin'</p>
    <p>Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction</p>
    
    <p>Wrong information always shown by the media</p>
    <p>Negative images is the main criteria</p>
    <p>Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria</p>
    <p>Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema, yo'</p>
    
    <p>Whatever happened to the values of humanity?</p>
    <p>Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?</p>
    <p>Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity</p>
    <p>Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity</p>
    
    <p>That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under</p>
    <p>That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down</p>
    <p>There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under</p>
    <p>Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found</p>
    <p>Now ask yourself</p>
    
    <p>Where is the love?</p>
    <p>Where is the love?</p>
    <p>Where is the love?</p>
    <p>Where is the love?</p>

    <p>Where is the love?</p>
    
    <p>Sing with me y'all (one world, one world)</p>
    <p>We only got (one world, one world)</p>
    <p>That's all we got (one world, one world)</p>
    <p>And something's wrong with it (yeah)</p>
    <p>Something's wrong with it (yeah)</p>
    <p>Something's wrong with the wo-wo-world, yeah</p>
    <p>We only got (one world, one world)</p>
    <p>That's all we got (one world, one world)</p>
